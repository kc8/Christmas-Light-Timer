Christmas Light Timer for outdoor lights. 

Simple script that turns christmas lights on or off depending on the time of day. This ran on a Raspberry PI with a relay to control a 120 volt outlet. The relay is in an ON state for the Christmas lights to recieve power and OFF for them to shut off. 

This script should be set to run when the Raspberry Pi powers on. It is then designed to consinsouley run. 

To-DO: 

This is a very simple script and we need much more funconality. Currently working on an API that can communicate with Relays and other GPIO Pins
